# Hello! üëã I'm Danilo

I'm a self-taught backend developer from Argentina with over 5 years of experience in software development. While I‚Äôm capable across the full stack, my true passion lies in backend engineering and systems-level programming. I specialize in building scalable APIs with **Node.js**, leveraging tools like **Express**, **Socket.io**, and **clustering** to handle high-concurrency environments.

I'm also proficient in **Next.js** for building reactive, SSR-enabled applications, but I prefer working under the hood ‚Äî dealing with servers, protocols, and performance.

On the low-level side, I‚Äôve developed utilities and high-performance tools in **C** and **Rust**, focusing on secure memory management, concurrency, and data parsing. I love working close to the metal when efficiency and control matter most.

In terms of data, I‚Äôm experienced with both **relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL)** and **non-relational (MongoDB, Redis)** databases. I've built complex schemas with triggers, joins, aggregation pipelines, and have worked on optimizing queries for large-scale applications.

Beyond development, I'm also enthusiastic about **networking and infrastructure security**. I frequently work with **Cloudflare**, configuring **firewalls**, **DDoS protection**, and **CDNs** for robust deployments. In my spare time, I dive into **advanced IPv6 networking** with **Netplan on Ubuntu**, setting up /48 and /64 subnet routing ‚Äî because I truly enjoy understanding how the internet works under the hood.

I've been learning and building consistently for over 5 years ‚Äî and I‚Äôm just getting started.
